I'm a computational biologist at <a href="http://vergegenomics.com" style="text-decoration:none">Verge Genomics</a>, where I'm helping to develop a next-generation drug discovery pipeline using machine learning. Previously, I was an assistant adjunct professor of Integrative Biology and Physiology at UCLA, using gene networks to predict the immune response in heart-failure patients receiving a ventricular assist device. I taught a statistics course for graduate students in the life sciences, and played the role of biostatistician for various collaborations in the Department of Medicine. I did my Ph.D. at UCLA in biophysics, developing diffusion tensor interpolation algorithms to improve computer simulations of cardiac electrophysiology. And before that, I worked on particle physics at CERN while an undergraduate at Caltech.
