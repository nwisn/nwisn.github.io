I'm a computational biologist at <a href="http://vergegenomics.com" style="text-decoration:none">Verge Genomics</a>, where I apply machine learning to develop a next-generation drug discovery pipeline. My role is to integrate transcriptomic networks, protein-protein interaction networks, and genetic associations into a recommendation system that prioritizes gene targets and small molecules for further investigation. These targets are then tested in stem cell and rodent models of a disease (i.e. Parkinson's Disease, ALS, etc.), and the results are used to improve the recommendation system, as well as optimize the experimental design.

Previously, I was an assistant adjunct professor at UCLA in the Department of Medicine, and the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, where I taught statistics and did an assortment of research. As principal statistician, I worked with collaborators modeling all kinds of data, including genomics, EEG/EKG, stem cells, fitbit, and criminal profiling. Before that, I was a biophysics graduate student at UCLA, using the information geometry of diffusion tensors to improve computational models of cardiac electrophysiology. And before that, I worked on particle physics at CERN and Fermilab, looking for evidence of the Higgs boson and supersymmetry, while an undergraduate at Caltech.
