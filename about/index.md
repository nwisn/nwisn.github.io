I'm a computational biologist at <a href="http://vergegenomics.com" style="text-decoration:none">Verge Genomics</a>, where I'm applying machine learning to develop a next-generation drug discovery pipeline. Previously, I was an assistant adjunct professor at UCLA in the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, working to identify gene co-expression networks involved in the immune response following implantation of an artifical heart device. I taught a statistics course for graduate students in the life sciences, and acted as the statistician for various collaborations in the Department of Medicine. Before that, I did a biophysics Ph.D. at UCLA, working on statistical aspects of diffusion tensors in cardiac tissue. And before that, I worked at CERN while studying particle physics as an undergraduate at Caltech.
