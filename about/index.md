I am the director of biostatistics at <a href="https://www.avicenaheart.com/" style="text-decoration:none">Avicena</a>, where I use machine learning to non-invasively assess cardiovascular health. Previously, I worked with <a href="http://vergegenomics.com" style="text-decoration:none">Verge Genomics</a> to develop a next-generation drug discovery pipeline based in artificial intelligence. Before that, I was an assistant adjunct professor at UCLA, using gene networks to characterize the immune response in heart-failure patients receiving a ventricular assist device. I taught a statistics course for graduate students in the life sciences, and acted as statistician for various collaborations in the Department of Medicine. My PhD is in biophysics.
