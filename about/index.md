I'm a computational biologist at <a href="http://vergegenomics.com" style="text-decoration:none">Verge Genomics</a>, where I am applying machine learning to develop a next-generation drug discovery pipeline. Previously, I was an adjunct professor at UCLA, where I taught statistics and did biomedical research. I worked with collaborators modeling all kinds of data, including genomics, EEG/EKG, stem cells, fitbit, and criminal profiling. I worked in biophysics as a graduate student at UCLA, using the information geometry of diffusion tensors to improve computational models of cardiac electrophysiology. Before that, I worked on particle physics at CERN and Fermilab, while an undergraduate at Caltech.
