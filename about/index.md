I'm a data scientist with a background in physics, information geometry, biology, and medicine. At <a href="http://vergegenomics.com">Verge Genomics</a>, I am applying machine learning to develop a next-generation drug discovery pipeline. 

Previously, I was an adjunct professor in integrative biology and physiology at UCLA, where I taught statistics and did medical research. I worked with collaborations modeling all kinds of data, including genomics, EEG/EKG, stem cells, fitbit, and criminal profiling. 

Prior to that, I worked on information geometry and the statistics of diffusion tensors. And prior to that, I worked on particle physics at CERN.
