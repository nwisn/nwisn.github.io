I'm a computational biologist at <a href="http://vergegenomics.com">Verge Genomics</a>, where I am applying machine learning to develop a next-generation drug discovery pipeline. 


Previously, I was an adjunct professor at UCLA, where I taught statistics and did biomedical research. I worked with collaborators modeling all kinds of data, including genomics, EEG/EKG, stem cells, fitbit, and criminal profiling. 


Prior to that, I worked in biophysics, using the information geometry of diffusion tensors to improve computational models of cardiac electrophysiology. And prior to that, I worked in particle physics at CERN.
