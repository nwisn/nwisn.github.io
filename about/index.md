I am the senior director of bioinformatics and data sciences at <a href="https://www.stemsontx.com/" style="text-decoration:none">Stemson Therapeutics</a>, where I am working with an amazing team scientists to develop a novel iPSC-based cell therapy and organoid platform. My passion is building biotech startups that leverage artificial intelligence in diagnostics, devices, and drug discovery, to address unmet needs in healthcare technology. Prior to joining Stemson, I led teams at Progenity/Biora, Singular Genomics, Avicena, and Verge Genomics; and was faculty at UCLA where I taught statistics and led cross-disciplinary collaborations in genomics, medicine, and physiology. I have a physics BS from Caltech, a biophysics PhD from UCLA, and post-doctoral training in biostatistics and bioinformatics.
