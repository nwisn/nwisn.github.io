I'm a computational biologist at <a href="http://vergegenomics.com" style="text-decoration:none">Verge Genomics</a>, where I apply machine learning to develop a next-generation drug discovery pipeline. My job is to integrate different kinds of genomics and bioinformatics data into a recommendation system that prioritizes gene targets and small molecules for further investigation.

Previously, I was an assistant adjunct professor at UCLA in the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, where I did research identifying the gene networks involved in the immune response to surgical intervention in heart failure. I also taught statistics, and provided statistical support to a number of collaborations by modeling EEG/EKG, stem cell proliferation, fitbit, and criminal profiling datasets. Before that, I did a biophysics Ph.D. at UCLA, working on statistical aspects of diffusion tensors in cardiac tissue. And before that, I worked at CERN while studying particle physics as an undergraduate at Caltech.
