I will be presenting my work with David Jimenez on forensic psychology and machine learning at [InPACT2017](http://inpact-psychologyconference.org/2017/) in Budapest, Hungary. Our paper is titled: [Patterns of abuse: profiling child sex abuse cases using machine learning](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rn6E9TVQuFfH6Joeog7qH4tijvBWLeOH), and we also have a [poster](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fRGm1qQMM4vEYjzaAmSC5XY1HSVHLszk).

Our abstract provides a brief summary:
>> In forensic psychology, there is practical interest in identifying major patterns of child sexual abuse, and associating a risk with each pattern. To this aim, we applied machine learning to a novel dataset of (n=254) pre-trial case studies conducted by a single court-appointed forensic psychologist in Los Angeles and surrounding counties, over the years 1997-2013. The case studies consist of full police reports, including victim interviews and medical reports, accompanied by corresponding suspect interviews conducted by the forensic psychologist. Our results suggest a large number of conditional dependencies between risk factors that can be used to identify patterns of abuse, and stratify motifs according to risk. These motifs provide an intuitive framework in which risk can be largely understood by combinations of 5 primary features: length of abuse, threat of force, age of victim, relationship to victim, and courtship behavior.
