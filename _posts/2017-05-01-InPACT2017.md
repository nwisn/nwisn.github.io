I will be presenting my work with David Jimenez on forensic psychology and machine learning at [InPACT2017](http://inpact-psychologyconference.org/2017/) in Budapest, Hungary. Our paper is titled: [Patterns of abuse: profiling child sex abuse cases using machine learning](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rn6E9TVQuFfH6Joeog7qH4tijvBWLeOH), and we also have a [poster](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fRGm1qQMM4vEYjzaAmSC5XY1HSVHLszk).
