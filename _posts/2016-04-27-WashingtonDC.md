I will be presenting results on using gene expression networks to predict mechanical circulatory support outcomes, on April 27, 2016, at the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation conference in Washington D.C. A copy of my full slide deck is available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vqbvuoytVa8-ecyX158ssOnvzKlJ81pL).

The following poster summarizes our work:
